/// perfectly still document — sub-pixel edge noise makes an overlay drawn
/// straight from them shimmer. This applies a per-corner exponential moving
/// average (EMA): each new frame nudges the displayed corner a fraction
/// [smoothing] of the way toward the raw corner, so small jitter averages out
/// while real movement still tracks.
///
/// It is deliberately tiny, pure, and optional — feed it corners yourself, or
/// pass it to `DocumentDetector.detectStream(stabilize: ...)`. It holds one
/// frame of state, so use one instance per detection session and [reset] it (or
/// let it auto-reset) when the document leaves.

  ///
  /// [resetDistance] (normalized 0..1) is a jump threshold: if any corner moves
